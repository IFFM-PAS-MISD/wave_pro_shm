## WaveProSHM

The **Wave Propagation for Structural Health Monitoring (WaveProSHM)** is a streamlined implementation of the time domain spectral element method (SEM) dedicated to modelling guided wave-based structural health monitoring (SHM) systems.
Such systems are composed of an array of piezoelectric transducers (actuators and sensors) able to excite and sense elastic waves, in particular guided waves such as Lamb waves in thin plates. To facilitate the design of SHM systems and damage identification algorithms, **WaveProSHM** enables the solution of coupled electromechanical equations of motion.

It is intended to use **WaveProSHM** in conjunction with open source [GMSH](https://gmsh.info/) and [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/).
GMSH is used for mesh preparation, **WaveProSHM** for the computation of elastic wave propagation problems and Paraview for the visualisation of results.

**WaveProSHM** is a result of research on several SHM-related projects.

## Installation requirements

**WaveProSHM** was developed and tested in MATLAB version 9.14 (R2023a) environment. 
It may or may not be compatible with previous versions of MATLAB.
In order to fully benefit from **WaveProSHM**, the Parallel Computing Toolbox is required since it enables running parallel computations on GPU. 
Tests were performed on Parallel Computing Toolbox version 7.8 (R2023a).
Apart from that, CUDA-compatible GPU must be installed in the system.

**WaveProSHM** still can be used without Parallel Computing Toolbox by setting computations on CPU but it is not recommended since computations take much longer.

Installation instructions
------------------------

Copy ``WaveProSHM.mlappinstall`` from the ``bin`` directory to your computer. 
Open MATLAB, select the APPS tab, click Install App and select ``WaveProSHM.mlappinstall`` on your hard drive.
**WaveProSHM** will appear on your ribbon with APPS and can be run from there.

Default installation path:

* In the Linux system it is installed in your home directory under:
```bash
  /home/username/MATLAB Add-Ons/Apps/WaveProSHM/
```
	
* In the Windows system it is installed in the directory:
```console
  C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\MathWorks\MATLAB Add-Ons\Apps\WaveProSHM\
``` 	

Please note that simple examples of meshes and inputs are stored in the installation directory in a folder ``examples``.

Also, a detailed manual in the pdf format can be found in the installation directory in the folder ``docs``.
